# AgentAnalytics Frontend Code Challenge

This repository is created and prepared for Agentanalytics by [SuJi Lee](https://github.com/sujilee91), and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This project contains a simple app that displays the weather in three cities of my choice: Calgary, Seoul, and Munich.

Implemented a fully functional React app based on the mockup and the style of the application is implemented as close as possible to the mockup that Agentanalytics have provided.

All weathers are presented by icon asset (asset/weather.svg), from [Orion Icon Pack](https://orioniconlibrary.com/icon-pack/weather?style=color).

### Details

As AgentAnalytics provided mockup image size in 2536px \* 1368px, base style of application is implemented for 2536px and 1440px (laptop size).
To see the best result of UI implementation, please make sure to set the width of your browser to 2536px OR 1440px.

### Responsiveness

This app is fully responsive from a minimum of 351 pixels.
Here are the breakpoints I have used:

- Mobile: 351px ~ 720px
- Tablet: 721px ~
- Laptop: 961px ~
- Desktop: 1440px ~
- Large: > 1441px
